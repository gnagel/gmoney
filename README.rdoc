    portfolio.positions #where portfolio is an instance of the Portfolio class

    Position.find
    position.transactions #where position is an instance of the Position class
    
    Transaction.find
   
  all take a hash as an optional last parameter.  Valid values for this hash are:

  * :returns - By default Google does not return a comprehensive list of returns data.  Set this parameter to true to access this information.
  * :refresh - GMoney caches the data returned from Google by default.  Set :refresh => true if you would like to get the latest data.
  * :eager - GMoney lazily loads children data (i.e. positions for a given Portfolio).  If you would like to load all of this data at once set :eager => true
